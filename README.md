In this MCdonadls case study, I written python code in Jupyter Notebook for all the ten steps regarding market segmentation analysis.
Import the dataset provided, i.e "mcdonalds.csv".
Now in data-preprocessing phase:
1. Convert the categorical data to numerical data
2. Check for NULL values or other indertiminant symbols.
3. 
And then for extracting segments, KMeans clustering was used.

So, using elbow method I got 4 clusters as you can see in provided ipnyb file.

And datapoints also visualised in a scatterplot of all four clusters.

And in the step profiling segments about each cluster has been analysed.

Next step is describing segments, Descriptor variables
– additional pieces of information about consumers – are critically important to
gaining a good understanding of market segments.

Here, descriptor variable are Like and Gender, both are compared and plotted mosiac plots.

And then next step is selecting the target segments, here I used Decision tree classification algorithm.

And also tree has been plotted you can see it in ipynb file.

Next step is customising the marketing matrix.

Finally evaluation and monitoring, last step among all 10.

And here we got an accuracy of 96.21993127147766 %
